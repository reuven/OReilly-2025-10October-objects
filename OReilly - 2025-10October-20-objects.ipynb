    "Software has always been hard to write, and even harder to maintain. When people came up with higher-level languages, they thought that things would get easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1970s, people were overwhelmed by software and its complexity -- especially when they wanted to maintain/debug/change software. They wanted a new way to write code that would make it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Kay, working at Xerox PARC, designed a new programming language called Smalltalk. Smalltalk used \"objects.\" What did that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay talked about the human body and biological systems as being hugely complex and yet working well. This happens because the body is divided into many cells. Each cell has a different type -- nerve cells, skin cells, fat cells, muscle cells. Each type of cell sends and receives different types of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smalltalk was designed such that each type of data you wanted to work with had a \"type\" that determined what messages it would send and receive. The messages were known as \"methods,\" but they were really glorified function calls. The idea was that you could know what types of messages were sent and received by a particular piece of data, based on its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, we have objects\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, we have classes\n",
    "- Instead of messages, we have methods\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are hard for people, because they are different from the rest of programming. Nearly every programming language today uses objects in some way or another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need objects? To make our code easier to understand, read, and write. It's really a system for packaging our software, so that it's easier to do those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still object skeptics, who say that there really isn't any huge advantage in using them. But most programmers and most languages are pushing us to use objects, because they can make things easier to build and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some people, objects are almost a religion. If you do things the object way, then you're right. And if you don't, then you're wrong. Python doesn't have this approach at all! Python encourages you to use objects, and all of the data is packaged as objects, and we'll use methods, as well -- but if you want to write non-object code, you completely can do that in Python."

You've seen classes before -- `str` is a class, as is `int`. The big deal with object-oriented programming is that you can create new types/classes, and they will be no more and no less a part of Python than `str` and `int`.\n",

If you want to find out the type of a given object, you can invoke the `type` builtin function. It'll return the type of an object.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The `class` keyword in Python tells the language that we want to define a new type of data, parallel to `str`, `list`, `dict`, and all of the others. Our class (data type) will be just as capable as those builtin data types.\n",
    "2. When we define a class, we give it a name. Traditionally, that name is in `CamelCase`.\n",
    "3. We need a colon at the end of the line, indicating that we're about to open an indented block. That block is known as the \"class body.\" Most of the class body will consist of method definitions, all starting with `def`. We will see some other things we can put there tomorrow.\n",
    "4. When we use `def` inside of a class body, we're defining a *method*, a function that is connected to our data type. Only objects of type `Person` will be able to use any method defined here.\n",
    "5. `__init__` is a special method, a *magic* method, that is invoked by Python automatically when we create a new instance. We'll talk about that in a moment.\n",
    "6. We define our `__init__` with four parameters: `self` (which is mandatory for any method), then three more parameters. `self` will be assigned the instance of `Person` on which we're running, and that'll happen automatically. The other three parameters get their values from the arguments we pass to `Person` when we invoke it.\n",
    "7. The job of `__init__` is to assign attributes (i.e., names and values) to `self`, the new instance. When `__init__` is invoked, `self` is an object, but a \"naked\" object, without any attributes that make it special. Our job in `__init__` is to assign to `self`, one at a time, the attributes that'll make it truly an object of type `Person`.\n",
    "8. `__init__` doesn't return any value. The assignments to `self` are enough.\n",
    "9. Do all of my parameters need to be used in assigning to `self`? No, but that's common. Can I assign attributes to `self` that have nothing to do with the parameters? Yes, and that's fine."

    "Python has *two* different storage mechanisms for values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables, which can be local (in a function) or global (available everywhere)\n",
    "- Attributes, which are connected to a particular object. You can think of attributes as a private dict on each value in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can you tell the difference? Because attributes are tied to a particular object, you need to say both the object and the attribute; you cannot just say the attribute. The way you do that is with a `.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I ask for `p.first_name`, I'm asking `p` (the Person object) to give me the value of its `first_name` attribute. Fortunately, that was assigned back in `__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking for `p.first_name` means that Python turns to `p` and says: Do you have an attribute `first_name`? This has *NOTHING* to do with local or global variables. (`p` is a global variable, but `first_name` is an attribute on `p`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python use attributes a *lot*. Every time you see a `.`, that means: We're asking an object for its attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other programming languages talk about \"instance variables\" and \"class variables.\" Many instructors in Python use this terminology also. I prefer not to do so, because the moment you understand that these are all attributes, the language becomes more obviously consistent and easier to understand."

    "A namespace is a collection of variables. Typically, Python has a global namespace and a local namespace (when a function is running). There is also a \"builtin\" namespace for names like `str`, `int`, `dict`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's true, though, that Python uses modules and classes as a form of namespace, also. However, those aren't for variables. They are, instead, for attributes. You can see that because if you use a class or a module, you'll be using lots of `.` characters between the module/class name and its attributes."
