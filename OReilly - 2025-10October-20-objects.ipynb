    "Software has always been hard to write, and even harder to maintain. When people came up with higher-level languages, they thought that things would get easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1970s, people were overwhelmed by software and its complexity -- especially when they wanted to maintain/debug/change software. They wanted a new way to write code that would make it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Kay, working at Xerox PARC, designed a new programming language called Smalltalk. Smalltalk used \"objects.\" What did that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay talked about the human body and biological systems as being hugely complex and yet working well. This happens because the body is divided into many cells. Each cell has a different type -- nerve cells, skin cells, fat cells, muscle cells. Each type of cell sends and receives different types of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smalltalk was designed such that each type of data you wanted to work with had a \"type\" that determined what messages it would send and receive. The messages were known as \"methods,\" but they were really glorified function calls. The idea was that you could know what types of messages were sent and received by a particular piece of data, based on its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, we have objects\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, we have classes\n",
    "- Instead of messages, we have methods\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are hard for people, because they are different from the rest of programming. Nearly every programming language today uses objects in some way or another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need objects? To make our code easier to understand, read, and write. It's really a system for packaging our software, so that it's easier to do those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still object skeptics, who say that there really isn't any huge advantage in using them. But most programmers and most languages are pushing us to use objects, because they can make things easier to build and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some people, objects are almost a religion. If you do things the object way, then you're right. And if you don't, then you're wrong. Python doesn't have this approach at all! Python encourages you to use objects, and all of the data is packaged as objects, and we'll use methods, as well -- but if you want to write non-object code, you completely can do that in Python."

    "- `class` and `type` -- these words are interchangeable when we speak, but they have different roles in Python itself. The idea is that each class/type is a category of value. You've seen classes before -- `str` is a class, as is `int`. The big deal with object-oriented programming is that you can create new types/classes, and they will be no more and no less a part of Python than `str` and `int`.\n",

    "    - `str`, the type, can also be used to create new instances of `str`, i.e., new strings. So when you say `str(5)`, you're creating a new `str` instance based on the `int` object `5`.\n",

If you want to find out the type of a given object, you can invoke the `type` builtin function. It'll return the type of an object.\n",
    "- `object` -- this word is overused *FAR* too much in object-oriented programming. It means a value -- `5` and `'abcd'` are both objects. But every class is also an object, because everything in Python is an object. We also have a class called `object`, which is the \"parent\" of all classes out there."
